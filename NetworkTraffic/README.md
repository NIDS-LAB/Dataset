# CIC-DDoS2019

This repository contains a dataset focused on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which pose a significant threat to network security by overwhelming target networks with malicious traffic. 

### Dataset Overview

Due to the limitations of GitHub's storage capacity, the dataset has been uploaded to OneDrive. You can access it [here](https://waynestateprod-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hi8289_wayne_edu/EjdxG7raovZAhEYoxA-9nvAB7aFg4vV--q0LGl0OCRnUUQ?e=ltf0oW).

### Dataset Contents
